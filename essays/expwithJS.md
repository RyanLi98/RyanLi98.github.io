Luckily for me, my current job as a Web Application Developer at the UH ITS building gave me some experience with Javascript. While I am currently writing JUnit tests for code coverage, I have written some code with regards to Javascript, more specifically using AngularJS which is a framework. From my experience so far with Javascript I believe it is THE top language for front-end development as it is very versatile. There are frameworks for everything ranging from the front-end(React, Angular), back-end(Express) mobile development (React Native), and even desktop applications (Electron).

From a software-engineering perspective, I would say Javascript is one of the more user-friendly languages when compared to C or C++.  It is also quick and easy to pick-up as you do not have to define data types such as ints or floats and since Javascript is run on the client-side you can see results almost instantaneously instead of waiting for a response from the server. 

Athletic Software Engineering is beneficial as it forces you to complete a "Work-out of the Day" a.k.a WOD which are programming problems that have to be completed within a certain amount of time. WODs help test your programming knowledge and even strengthens them as you will be under stress.  Critical thinking is a hard skill to teach as it requires years of practice and I believe WODs, while stressful will help you practice and hone this skill. Overall I see WODs being a very useful teaching method and hope to see it in other classes.
