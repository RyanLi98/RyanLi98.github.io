# Standards
Often coding standards are viewed as a nuisance due to the fact that even an indent at the wrong place could produce a big fat !. However this is a minor inconvenience to producing something readable. Coding standards are like a set of rules you have to abide by, which I think are necessary to being a good software developer. For big projects with thousands of lines of code having a standard will not only help the developer but help with its readability and debugging.

A project without a standard not only makes it confusing to incoming developers but also developers who have to been on the project already. While I do agree that coding standards can limit a developer's own coding style, once you abide by them not only do you make your own code more readable you also can detect bugs more easily.

# Practice makes Perfect
After using ESLint for a week I can say that its been useful to writing code. Once you have written enough with a certain standard it almost becomes ingrained with your code style. It becomes second nature to write readable code and that is only achievable through hours and hours of practice. Writing code that is readable is not teachable and is only done through hours of painful debugging. Having said that I hope to import Lint to my future projects and see that it becomes a standard there.
